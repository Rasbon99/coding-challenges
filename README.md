# Coding Challenges Repository

Welcome to my coding challenges repository! ðŸš€ Here, you'll find my solutions to various coding challenges that I used to prepare for the Algorithms and Data Structures exam during my master's degree in computer engineering at the University of Federico II in Naples.

## Challenges

The challenges included in this repository primarily focus on solutions involving backtracking and dynamic programming. These topics are crucial for mastering algorithmic problem-solving and are commonly encountered in coding interviews.

The challenges are sourced from platforms such as GeeksforGeeks and OnlineJudge. They cover a range of topics in computer science and are of varying difficulty levels. Some are moderately challenging, while others are more straightforward. I've carefully selected these challenges to help me enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by topic, with each folder containing the Python solutions to the corresponding challenges. Feel free to explore and use these solutions as a reference or learning resource.

## Disclaimer

Please note that the solutions provided here are my own interpretations and implementations. While some challenges may be common, others are specific to certain platforms. If you find these solutions helpful, I encourage you to explore further, experiment, and come up with your own solutions.

## Contribution

If you'd like to contribute or improve any of the existing solutions, feel free to submit a pull request. I'm open to collaboration and appreciate any constructive feedback.

Happy coding! ðŸš€

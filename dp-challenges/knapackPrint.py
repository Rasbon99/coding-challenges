""" Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value 
in the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays, val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] represent values and weights 
associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the items 
such that sum of the weights of those items of a given subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot break an item, 
either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

Input : val[] = {60, 100, 120};
        wt[] = {10, 20, 30};
        W = 50;
Output : 220 //maximum value that can be obtained
         30 20 //weights 20 and 30 are included. 

Input : val[] = {40, 100, 50, 60};
        wt[] = {20, 10, 40, 30};
        W = 60;
Output : 200
